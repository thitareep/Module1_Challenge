## HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title  

## Changes Made
-Added a more descriptive name with the company name as title  
-Added semantic tags (header, nav, section, artile, aside, footer)  
-Fixed the missing id to make the navigation link work  
-Consolidated any repetitive css and changed the selectors to be specific  
-Added alt text to describe the images  
-Added comments on both HTML and CSS
